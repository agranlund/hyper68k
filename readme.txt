68030 Hypervisor for running 68000 things

This is an unfinished, but to a degree working, hypervisor
for running 68000 Atari ST stuff on 68030 based Ataris.

Most of the core stuff is in place but there are many things
still missing or in need of fixing/improving for this
to be a properly usable program.

I have not touched this code in a long time so it was uploaded
as-in and may or may not be in a bit of a state.

src/notes.txt contains some old notes.

If you want something useful to happed then your best
bet is to try a cartridge-converted game.
I've been mostly testing with starwars and rick dangerous.

Everything in the core should be in place to make adding
floppy drive emulation through disk-images fairly easy
or at least possible.
